Modify the provided Client code such that the client is prompted to either enter a String or an int. In either case, the data is transmitted to the Server.

Modify the provided Server code such that it uses the following try-catch to parse the received data as a String or an Integer. If a String was sent, echo back the String to the Client, if an Integer was sent, append it to a growing ArrayList and send back the average of the elements in the ArrayList.

	Object message = input.readObject();
	try
	{
		Integer x = Integer.parseInt(message);
		//Your code goes here
	}
	catch(java.lang.NumberFormatException e)
	{
		String s = (String)message;
		//Your code goes here
	}

You will need to instantiate the ArrayList as ArrayList<Integer> since ArrayLists do not store primitive types.

You will need to use instanceof on both ends of the connection, and should display what is transmitted over the network on both ends.
